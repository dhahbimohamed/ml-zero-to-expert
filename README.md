# Mohamed Dhahbi â€“ ML Mastery Journey ðŸš€

This repository tracks my hands-on journey to becoming a top-level ML engineer and data scientist.

## ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s Inside
- Python + NumPy + pandas notebooks
- Machine learning projects with scikit-learn
- Exploratory data analysis
- Visualizations and evaluation metrics
# About the first two days :
- Day 1: focused on Python basics like variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.
- Day 2: introduced NumPy arrays and basic data operations to build numerical coding fluency for ML
